// functions, return, prompt()

Example:
---------------------------------
Create a function secondLetter() that asks for a word 
and shows the second letter of it.

function secondLetter() {
   let word = prompt("Enter a word:");
   console.log(`The second letter of ${word} is ${word[1]}`);
}

Create a function getThirdUpper() that asks for one word 
   and returns it's third letter in upper case.

function getThirdUpper() {
   let word = prompt("Enter a word:");
   return word[2].toUpperCase();
}
        
1. Create a function showInitials() that asks for 
   the first name and for the last name with prompts
   and shows the initials.

   Call this function and see the results:
   //Example:
   showInitials();        // The user enters "Yocheved", "Hileli"
        // result: "Yocheved, your initials are Y.H."

2. Create a function getFirst() that asks for one word 
   and returns it's first letter.

   Call this function 3 times and see the results:
   console.log(getFirst());          // The user enters "strong"
                                     // result: s
   
   console.log(getFirst());       // The user enters "BEAUTIFUL"
                                  // result: B

   console.log(`The first letter of your word is "${getFirst()}".`);       
        // The user enters "finish"
        // result: The first letter of your word is "f".

3. Create a function showHeader() that asks for 
   the header of the article and shows the header
   between rows of stars.

   Call this function and see the results:
   //Example:

   console.log(`Dear ${getFullName()}, you're invited to our lecture`);       
          // The user enters "Mary" and "Brown"
          // result: Dear Mary Brown, you're invited to our lecture

5. Create a function sqrtMult3() that asks for one number 
   and shows the exercise of taking square root of the number 
   and multiplying it by 3.

   sqrtMult3();        // The user enters 36
                       //   result: Math.sqrt(36) * 3 = 18

6. Create a function squareMinus10Mult2() that asks for one number 
   and returns the result of rising the number in power 2 minus 10
   and multiplying all by 2

   Call this function 2 times and see the results:
   console.log(squareMinus10Mult2());     // The user enters 11
                                          // result: 222
   console.log(squareMinus10Mult2() - 15)); // The user enters 11
                                            // result: 207

7. CHALLENGE CHALLENGE
   Create a function showExercise(n) that gets 1 number
   as a parameter and shows the exercise of division 
   of the given number by 5 writh remainder,
   using document.write().

   Example:
   showExercise(33); // result: 33 / 5 = 6 remainder 3
   showExercise(33); // result: 33 / 5 = 6 remainder 3

8. Create a function getExercise(m,n) that gets 2 numbers
   and returns the exercise of division of the 1st given number
   by the 2nd given number - with remainder.

   Example:
   console.log(getExercise(41,6)); // result: 41 / 6 = 6 remainder 5
   let num1 = 101, num2 = 11
   console.log(getExercise(num1,num2)); 
                                   // result: 101 / 11 = 9 remainder 2
   console.log(`The exercise is: 
                   ${getExercise(num1,num2)}`); 
   // result:
      The exercise is: 
        101 / 11 = 9 remainder 2
