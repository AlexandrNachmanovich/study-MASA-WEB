Examples:
------------------------------------------
Set variable firstVar and assign it an integer.
let firstVar = 17
Set variable secondVar and assign it an integer.
let secondVar = 18
Create variable rem and assign it a remainder of
    the division of firstVar by secondVar.
let rem = firstVar % secondVar;
Show it at the console.
console.log("The remainder of the division of " 
             + firstVar + " by " + secondVar 
             + " is " + rem)
Show it at the HTML page, using document.write()
        and some header tags inside.
document.write("<h3>The remainder of the division of " 
             + firstVar + " by " + secondVar 
             + "<br>is " + rem + </h3>)

        the division of num3 by num4.
   Show it at the console.
   Show it at the HTML page, using document.write()
        and some header tags inside.

5. Set variables m, n, o, p, assign them numeric values.
   Set variable calculation,
      subtract from m the division of n by o and 
      multiply all this by p.
   Show the calculation result at the HTML page, 
        using document.write() 
        and some header tags inside.

6. Set variables firstName and lastName, and assign
   them some firstName and some lastName respectively.
   Set variable grade and assign it an integer.
   Show at the html page a statement that will look like 
   "<firstName> <lastName>, your grade is <grade>",
   for example:
   "Moshe Rosenfield, your grade is 87"

   to the doctor at <day> at <hour> o'clock exactly",
   for example:
   "Ms. Jane Smith, you've got an appointment to 
    the doctor at Thirsday at 5 o'clock exactly"
