// Replacing a primitive variable value,
// using Math and String functions 

Examples:
------------------------------------------
Set variable a and assign it a number. 
let a = 25;
Now assign it square root from it's value rised in power of 3
plus 121.
a = Math.sqrt(a) ** 3 + 121;
consoel.log('Math.sqrt(a) ** 3 + 121 = ' + a);

Set variable b and assign it a word.
let b = 'strange';
Now assign to b the 2nd letter of the word plus 5th letter of the word.
b = b[1] + b[4];
console.log('b[1] + b[4] = ' + b);

Set variable c and assign it a word in upper case.
let c = 'FLOWER';
Now make c to be in lower case.
c = c.toLowerCase();

1. Set variable num1 and assign it a number. 
   Replace it by it's value plus 15.
   Show the result at the console.

2. Set variable num2 and assign it a number. 
   Now assign it it's value,
   subtracted by 77.
   Show the result at the console.

3. Set variable num3 and assign it a number. 
   Now assign it it's value multiplied by 5 plus 5.

4. Set variable num4 and assign it a number. 
   Now assign it square root from it's value rised in power of 5
   minus 333.

5. Use num1, num2, num3, num4 for calling Math.max and 
   assign the result to num4.

6. Use num1, num2, num3 for calling Math.min and assign 
   the result to num3.

7. Set variable num5 and assign it an integer
   larger than 1000.
   Now assign it it's value,
   subtracted by the remainder of it's division by 10,
   and the whole divided by 10.

8. Set variable str1 and assign it a word.
   Now assign to str1 the 1st letter of the word.

9. Set variable str2 and assign it a word.
   Now assign to str2 the 3rd letter of the word.

10. Set variable str3 and assign it a word.
   Now assign to str3 the 3rd letter of the word 
   plus the 4th letter of the word.

11. Set variable str4 and assign it a word.
   Now assign to str4 the 2nd letter of the word 
   plus the last letter of the word.

12. Set variable str5 and assign it a word in lower case.
   Now make str5 to be in upper case.  

13. Set variable str6 and assign it a word in upper case.
   Now make str6 to be in lower case.
