HTML - input for the maximum 
     - explain the rules, what are the valid inputs
     - "Start Game" button that initializes the game
     - input for adding a number 
     - output (outpus) for seeing the machine turns,
       and the overall game flow
       (show that the machine thinks in it's turn - use setTimeout())

Mode1 

    - machine randomly chooses who plays first
    - Whe the machine plays, it chooses randomly 
      the number to add (for example, from the range from 1 to 9)
    - If this is the last winning step for the machine, it
      cannot add random number.
      For example the sum before it's turn is 94 - here we should
      calculate the difference to 100
    - validate the inputs of the player:

      - it is an positive integer
      - it is in the range from 1 to 9
      - in the winning position, disable adding numbers that
        make sum greater than 100

    --   Check if the machine or the player has already won

Mode2

    - human chooses who plays first
    - machine uses winning stratege and wins if can

  Turn of computer
  ----------------
  Global variable "sum". 

  Try to get to the next tenth:

    -- check if it is already some round number:

       if (sum % 10 === 0)

          it is already round, so
            machine choosing to add some random number from 1 to 9

    -- if it is not, complete to the round number:

        toAdd = 10 - sum%10
 

    --   Check if the machine has already won

    PAY ATTENTION: there will be functions common for both 
                Mode 1 and Mode 2 (except of Machine Turn)

Mode3 - optional 

    - player can choose the max number to add
    - we should invent the winning strategy

Mode 4 - optional - original game with two sets of numbers
       (stacks of items)

Mode 5 - more than 2 players

Optional (shoud use createElement) - illustrate the game
with disappearing stones or matches or sticks ...
