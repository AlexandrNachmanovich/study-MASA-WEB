2. To check that NodeJS is already installed and which version, run 
   in the command line (stand alone Git Bash or terminal): 

   $ node --version
   >node --version

3. To run a file app01.js: 

   $ node app01.js

4. To restart the server when some changes are performed, 
   we install "nodemon" — it will monitor the changes 
   and other files and restart the server.

   npm — "node package manager" 
   i _ install 
   -g — flag that says "globally"

   $ npn i -g nodemon
