0. Install git (for Git Bash)

For example, from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

To run Git Bash:

   Option 1:
      Windows Start -> Git Bash -> Open (or Run as Administrator)

   Option 2:

      Restart VS CODE

      VS CODE -> Terminal -> New Terminal
        
        power shell in the terminal is opened 

        Choose Git Bash from the list "v"

   GIT BASH COMMANDS 
   ----------------------------------------------------------------

   ls - list - shows list of directories and other files in the current directory

   ls data  - shows list of directories and other files in the directory "data"

   cd les17 - change directory to directory les17
   
   cd -     - change directory to the previous directory

   cd       - change directory to your user home

   cd ..  - get out from the current directory

   cd ../.. - get out from the current directory and the dir before the current directory

   Ctrl-C - break current command run
   
   <tab> - completes the name of the file 

   pwd - check working directory

   




1. Download and install NodeJS:

   Choose even version if you need it for production - it is a stable version

   Choose odd version if you want the latest features - it is not a stable version


   Restart VS CODE, restart command line (Git Bash)  

2. To check that NodeJS is already installed and which version, run 

   in the command line (stand alone Git Bash or terminal):

   $ node --version

   > node --version 

3. To run a file app01.js:

   $ node app01.js


4. To restart the server when some changes are performed,
   we install "nodemon" - it will monitor the changes in *.js 
   and other files and restart the server.

   npm - "node package manager"
   i - install
   -g - flag that says "globally"

   $ npm i -g nodemon
